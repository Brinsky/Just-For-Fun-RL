A disorganized and directionless roguelike. This project is just for kicks -
anyone is welcome to contribute.

Built using GCC and ncurses. It can probably be made to run with different
compilers and curses implementations, but it hasn't yet.

-- LINUX / MAC --

With the ncurses library and headers installed (and GCC, of course), running
`make` should build the game.

-- BUILDING ON WINDOWS --

It might be possible to build the game with a Windows-compatible curses port
(like PDCurses), but the easiest way is through Cygwin. A Cygwin environment
with the following extra packages should be suitable for compiling/developing
the game: gcc-core, libncurses-devel, libncursesw10, git.

After Cygwin and the above packages are installed, simply open the Cygwin
terminal, navigate to the game's source directory (or create it with `git
clone`) and run `make`.
